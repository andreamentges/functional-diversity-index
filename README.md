# Code for functional diversity index
Calculating functional molecular diversity of marine dissolved organic matter

This is the computer code corresponding to the following publication:

"Functional Molecular Diversity of Marine Dissolved Organic Matter Is Reduced during Degradation"  
Andrea Mentges, Christoph Feenders, Maren Seibt, Bernd Blasius, and Thorsten Dittmar
Frontiers in Marine Science, 2017 
doi: 10.3389/fmars.2017.00194
URL: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2017.00194/full 

The repository contains both a MATLAB and an R script to calculate functional diversity from a list of signal intensities and associated molecular traits.
